openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout nginx-selfsigned.key -out nginx-selfsigned.crt


this is the command to generate the ssl certs for our use case

-openssl req => initiates a certificate request generation process
-x509 => Telss openssl to output a certificate in this standard certificate format
-nodes => tells openssl not to encrypt the private key with a passphrase
-days 365 =? specifies validity period of the certificate, in this case , 1 year
-newkey rsa:2048 => creates a 2048 bit RSA key pair
    RSA = most common public key encryption algo
-keyout nginx-selfsigned.key => specifies the outputfile for the generated private key
-out nginx-selfsigned.crt => specifiesthe output file for the selfsigned certificate
    => contains public key
